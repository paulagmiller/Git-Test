This is the template file set for template NES_TS Medical Devices Data Hub.v0( f107d367-f955-445c-9f58-fb944be14e2d, revision 10), exported from the Clinical Knowledge Manager.

Important Note:
===============
This zip file includes 1 implicitly used parent archetype of specialised archetypes explicitly used by the template.
Parent archetypes - unless by chance used directly by the same template as well - are not needed to e.g. construct the Operational Template and are only provided in this zip-file for convenience, in the hope that they may be helpful for users with purposes such as converting or diffing archetypes. All ADL 1.4 archetypes - including specialised archetypes - are however stand-alone and thus no guarantee can be made by CKM that the provided parent archetype is the best possible fit for the specialised child archetype used by the template. As a best effort, CKM provides the revision of the parent archetype that was available in CKM at the time of uploading the revision of the specialised archetype used by the exported template. If no parent archetype existed in CKM at that point in time, its first revision is provided.
